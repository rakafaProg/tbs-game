# TBS Game

## City Building Game

> PHP advanced exercise

In this game we have buildings that can get updated on every stage.

Every building has:

- Name
- Level
- Cost for the next stage in materials
- Cost for the next stage in money

The game will be written in MVC Design pattern,
using classes and inheritence.

In this example we will have array that represents the database for the data of the game.
